Slack webhook/bot for notifying a channel of JSON responses from ping and healthcheck endpoints
for one or more supplied domains. It is hosted on heroku [here](https://slack-pingu.herokuapp.com/)

**SETUP**

This webhook/bot has been integrated into the MoJ Digital & Technology Slack workspace
using the [Outgoing Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/outgoing-webhooks) app.

Currently it is only activated for the #cccd_development channel. Once available in your (or all) channels
within the workspace you just need to enter the relevant text into a slack channel.

```
# Check pingu is available
pingu help
```

**SETUP your own**

 - fork the repository
 - deploy to your prefered host ([Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Now](https://zeit.co/now))
 - Add the [Outgoing Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/outgoing-webhooks) app into your slack workspace \*
 - Add an outgoing webhook integration \*
 - Configuration of the outgoing webhook involves specifying a channel (or any), trigger word(s) and the URL to which an HTTP POST will be performed. Copy the token provided here and modify you deployment environment to store an environment variable named SLACK_API_TOKEN with its value.

```
# example configuration of heroku deployed webhook with token
heroku config:set SLACK_API_TOKEN=my-token-from-outgoing-webhook-config
```

\* requires Admin consent

**USAGE**

Once activated for all channels typing the following into slack will
issue the callback to the webhook, resulting in response being sent
to the channel.

Any domains specified must have paths for ping and/or healthcheck

For help:

```
pingu [help|hi]
```

To call a ping endpoint on an app:
```
pingu ping domain-name[, domain-name-1][, domain-name-2]
```

To call a healthcheck endpoint on an app:
```
pingu healthcheck domain-name[, domain-name-1][, domain-name-2]
```
